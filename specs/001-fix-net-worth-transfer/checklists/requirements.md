# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix Net Worth Transfer Date Mismatch

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- One `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...]` marker remains in FR-007 regarding how transfers to/from off-budget or otherwise net-worth-excluded accounts should be treated. This marker is intentionally retained (not resolved) per explicit instruction — do not answer it via `/speckit-clarify` until a human confirms the desired behavior.
- All other items pass; the spec is otherwise ready to proceed once the clarification is addressed.
